-------> the user would be given a list of common goals or can also enter a custom goal
-------> the user would enter a timeline for achieving these goals
-------> the user would the choose frequency for doing these habits per week
-------> after that, the LLM would create a detailed plan for the user goal achievement
-------> these would be the actual habits that would be in checkboxes that the user has to complete
-------> the user's habit pattern i.e how he completes these tasks would be recorded in the appropriate database tables
-------> the UI dashboard would then reflect the habit patterns
-------> at the same time, notifications and emails would be sent to users to serve as reminders


ROUTES WOULD BE:
    / :-> landing page
    /auth :-> everything authentication
    /onboarding :-> initial user questions like: what are your goals?
    /dashboard :-> user habit pattern and overall user rewards, how closer user is to goal
    /tasks :-> daily, weekly tasks alongside verification, user rewards

-------> user can edit it manually and override LLM generated habits
-------> habits and goals are stored in database and user is redirected to /tasks where today's tasks are viewed
/tasks:
------->
